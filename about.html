<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student currently studying at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) in Gandhinagar. My expected graduation year is 2026. I have a strong interest in web development and data structures and algorithms (DSA). I am currently residing in Ahmedabad.

  In terms of competitive programming, I have a CodeChef rating of around 1100. While I acknowledge that my rating could be higher, I have solved a total of 20 problems on LeetCode, which I consider to be a good achievement. However, I am determined to improve both my problem-solving skills and my grammar to become a better programmer and communicator.
  
  To pursue my passion for web development and DSA, I plan to make the most of my time at DA-IICT. I will focus on taking relevant courses that cover programming languages, frameworks, databases, and algorithms to build a strong foundation. Additionally, I will work on personal web development projects and contribute to open-source projects to gain practical experience and collaborate with experienced developers.
  
  I believe that participating in coding competitions, hackathons, and attending tech meetups and conferences in Ahmedabad and nearby cities will help me enhance my skills, learn about the latest trends, and connect with professionals in the industry.
  
  While I am dedicated to my interests, I also understand the importance of maintaining a balance with my academic commitments. I will strive for excellence in my coursework and aim to achieve a good GPA.
  
  In conclusion, I am excited about my journey as a student at DA-IICT and my passion for web development and DSA. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I look forward to exploring various opportunities to improve my skills and make a positive impact in the tech community.
